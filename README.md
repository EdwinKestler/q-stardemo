Let's consider a simple example where an agent learns to navigate a gridworld environment using the Q-learning algorithm, which aims to approximate Q*. In this gridworld, the agent needs to find the shortest path to a goal while avoiding obstacles. We will use a simple representation where each cell in the grid can be a normal cell, an obstacle, or a goal.
Here's a breakdown of the setup:
Environment: A grid (e.g., 5x5) where each cell can be an empty space, an obstacle, or a goal. The agent starts from a random position and needs to reach the goal.
Actions: The agent can move up, down, left, or right.
Rewards: The agent receives a positive reward for reaching the goal, a negative reward for hitting an obstacle, and a smaller negative reward for each step (to encourage shortest path solutions).
Q-learning Algorithm: The agent will use Q-learning to learn the optimal policy. Q-values are updated after each action based on the reward received and the estimated future rewards.
Goal: The agent's objective is to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the total reward, effectively approximating Q* for this environment.
I'll write a Python script to simulate this scenario. Note that this example is quite basic and is intended for educational purposes to illustrate the concept of Q-learning and Q*. Let's proceed with the implementation.
The Python script demonstrates a Q-learning agent navigating a gridworld environment. The grid is a 5x5 matrix with obstacles and a goal. The agent's task is to find the shortest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles.
Here's a summary of the script's execution:
Environment Setup: A gridworld with obstacles and a goal is created. The agent can move up, down, left, or right.
Q-learning Agent: An agent is initialized with a Q-table to store the value of taking each action in each state. The agent explores the environment (random moves) and exploits its knowledge (choosing the best-known move).
Learning Process: During each episode, the agent updates its Q-table based on the rewards it receives for its actions. This update is done using the Q-learning algorithm, which incorporates immediate rewards and discounted future rewards.
Results: After 200 episodes, the agent has learned to navigate the gridworld more effectively. The printed reward values show the agent's performance in specific episodes. The final state of the grid is displayed, with the agent's position marked.
Observation: Initially, the agent might make less optimal decisions, but as it learns (approximates Q*), its ability to reach the goal efficiently improves. This is indicated by increasing reward values over episodes.
This example illustrates the fundamental principles of Q-learning in a simple gridworld environment. The agent's objective is to approximate the optimal action-value function (Q*) for each state-action pair, guiding it to make the best decisions based on its experience.
